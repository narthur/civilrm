# Your project's knowledge

Add any information here or instructions that will help Codebuff maintain your project.

## Package Management

This project uses `pnpm` instead of `npm`. Always use `pnpm` commands, e.g.:
- `pnpm install` or `pnpm add` for adding packages
- `pnpm run dev` for development
- `pnpm run build` for building
- `pnpm run typecheck` for type checking

## Verifying changes

After every change, run `pnpm run typecheck` to check for any errors that should be fixed.

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as its test runner and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for testing React components.

-   **Setup**: Test setup is configured in `vitest.setup.ts`, which imports `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` for extended Jest DOM matchers.
-   **Configuration**: Vitest configuration can be found in `vitest.config.ts`.
-   **Running Tests**:
    -   To run all tests once: `pnpm run test`
    -   To run tests in watch mode: `pnpm run test:watch`
-   **Example**: An example test can be found in `pages/_app.spec.ts`.
