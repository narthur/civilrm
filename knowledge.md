## Package Management

This project uses `pnpm` instead of `npm`. Always use `pnpm` commands, e.g.:
- `pnpm install` or `pnpm add` for adding packages
- `pnpm run dev` for development
- `pnpm run build` for building
- `pnpm run typecheck` for type checking

## Verifying changes

After every change, run `pnpm run typecheck` to check for any errors that should be fixed.
